              Hi there! Welcome to my online portfolio. My name is Julia Zhao 
              and I am a freshman at Dublin High who is taking the elective 
              course Computer Science  Principles. I hope that by taking this 
              course, I will be able to learn some of the basics for coding. 
              But this is not the career I want to pursue in the future. This 
              is in fact, a backup career if the first one does not work out 
              for me. If I end up following  this path, I plan to take on a job
              that involves this knowledge because coding is a big part of 
              everything on the Internet. It is the code that creates the unique
              look of websites, the layouts of apps, and even your computer. 
              You may not know it but coding is all around you. By taking this
              course, I will be diving deeper in this world that has become 
              integrated into our lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              I think that teamwork will help me in this career. I am on a swim
              team during the summer and I work well in group projects. Of the 
              jobs that come to mind, they all involve having good relations 
              with your coworkers and cooperation. If you do not have a good 
              connection,  may not be able to complete a project successfully 
              or in good quality. I am also a good listener so I notice if 
              someone is being quiet or is not participating. They are also 
              usually the type of people I become friends with. Things I have 
              learned about myself over the years is that I prefer to have 
              close friends, work well on teams, but I can work by myself too. 
              I can also adapt to new situations and surroundings pretty well.
            </p>
            <p>
              All in all, I think that this career path has a lot of potential
              for me. Thank you for your time! To learn more about me explore my
