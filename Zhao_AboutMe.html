            Hi there and welcome to my website. I am a freshman at Dublin High
            School who is taking the elective course Computer Science 
            Principles. I hope that by taking this course, I will be able to 
            learn some of the basics for coding. But this is not the career I 
            want to pursue in the future. This is in fact, a backup career if 
            the first one , being an athlete, does not work out for me. If in 
            the future, I end up following this path, I plan to take on a job 
            that involves this knowledge because coding is a big part of 
            everything on the Internet. It is the code that creates the unique 
            look of websites, the layouts of apps, and even your computer. You 
            may not know it but coding is all around you. By taking this 
            course, I will be diving deeper in this world that is integrated 
            into our lives. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I think that teamwork will help me in this career. I was on a 
            summer swim team and I work well in group projects. Of the jobs 
            that come to mind, they all involve having good relations with your
            coworkers and cooperation. If you do not have a good connection, 
            you may not be able to complete a project successfully or in good 
            quality. I am also a good listener so I notice if someone is being 
            quiet or is not participating. I always try to involve everyone 
            into a discussion. They also are usually the people I become friends
            with too. Things I have learned about myself over the years is that 
            I like have a few close friends, work well on teams, but I can also 
            manage alone. I can also adapt to new situations and surroundings.
          </p>
          <p>
            All in all, I think that this career path has a lot of potential
            for me. Thank you for your time! To contact me, go
