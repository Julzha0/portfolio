          <u>Career Goal</u>
        </h5>
        <p>
          I do not know what I want to be in the future because the paths I am 
          interested now clash together and I need more time to decide which one 
          I want to follow.
        </p>
        <h5 style="font-family: Playfair Display;">
          <u>Education</u>
        </h5>
        <p>
          I am a freshman that attends Dublin High School in Dublin, California.
          At this school, I am taking Physical Education, French 1, Biology with 
          Research, Freshmen Seminar, Geometry, Computer Science Principles, and
          English 1. I do not know which college I want to apply for because I 
          still have not really decided which career path I want to follow. 
          I do hope that I may be able to get a scholarship through swimming. 
          Computer science is a backup path in case it does not work out as 
          planned.
        </p>

          <u>Volunteer Experience</u>
        </h5>
        <p>
          For three days - July 29th, 2018 to July 31st, 2018 - I was a 
          volunteer ball kid for a tennis tournament, Mubadala Silicon Valley 
          Classic, hosted at San Jose State University for Women's Tennis 
          Association (WTA) players. Every day, I worked with a different team 
          for about eight hours to help make sure that the match flows as 
          quickly and efficiently as possible and the players have everything 
          they need. In order to be a ball kid, you should have some background
          knowledge of how a match is played and how the score is kept.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the last two weeks, from July 9th, 2018 to July 20th, 2018, 
          of my summer swim team, the Dublin Green Gators, I worked as an 
          assistant coach. What I would do for one hour after my practice, is 
          help correct  and improve the techniques of any younger swimmers that 
          the coaches decided needed help. To do this, I had to be able to 
          analyze the swimmer, and think of - maybe even create - drills to
          help the swimmer. If I could not think of any or the swimmer was just
          not picking up the skill, I could ask for help from the other 
          assistant coaches.
        </p>

          <u>Skills</u>
        </h5>
        <p>
          I work well with most people so when the class was assigned the two 
          pair-programming projects, I became acquaintances with my partners. I 
          also work well on my own and I am not afraid to ask for help when 
          needed. This is the most important aspect because if I need help but 
          decide not to ask for guidance, I will struggle and could reach an 
          incorrect result. I know when is the time to ask, and when it is not. 
          Usually when I talk to students seated around, it would be to compare 
          answers or to ask for help about the problem
        </p>
