              Computer Science Principles
            </h5>
            <p>
              This assignment was the first pair-programming project done in my 
              Computer Science Principles class. The code was done on a beginner
              level coding site called Scratch, a free online programming 
              language developed by MIT. Unlike normal coding languages, 
              Scratch uses a blocks. These blocks contain codes and you snap 
              them together to create lines of code. This is a great site for 
              beginner coders because it is easy and intuitive. Scratch is good 
              for making small games and animations. For the Scratch project, 
              we had to create a game. After my partner and I brainstormed, we 
              both decided on the idea where players get to choose their 
              spaceship which they move around using the right and left arrow 
              keys to shoot lasers at meteorites. As they progress, a different 
              spaceship appears which they should not hit or else they lose 
              points. During the time frame we were given, we were able to code
              in an instructions page, spaceship selection, and a score label. 
              We even were able to make the spaceship move left and right. But 
              we were unsuccessful in coding how to make the meteorites fall 
              towards Earth. By doing this project, I learned that sometimes 
              not everything works the way you want and you must find a way to 
              overcome the obstacle or go in a different direction.

              <strong>Python Image Manipulation</strong>

              For this project, we were pretend image developers
              with a chosen fake/real client with a set of requirements to meet. 
              My partner and I chose client #1: a cause. A description of what 
              the client wanted and the other client choices are listed below in
              the objective link. The project helped us practice manipulating 
              images using Python. The modifications that we did are all grouped
              together in this slideshow on the right. In this pairing, I did 
              more of the coding while my partner was the one that thought of 
              modifications we could implement onto the images. With my partner,
              With this project, we were allowed to choose our own partners. As 
              a result, some advantages that we had was that we already had ways
              to contact each other and we were friends so that meant that we 
              could be more direct and honest about our opinions. I learned that
              it was better to start off small and continue from there. My 
              partner wanted to do some fancy changes right from the start but I
              told them that we should start with something easy (e.g. a border) 
              and then build on from that. Eventually we were able to execute 
              some of the more complicated modifications that they wanted to do.
